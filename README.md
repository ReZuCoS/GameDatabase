# **Game database project**

## Desctiption

**Game Database** is my pet project that allows you to create lists of games you've completed and are planning to complete, as well as leave a rating of the game. The project is being created for educational purposes and generally clones the concept of the rawg.io website.

## Git

**Trunk Based Development** was chosen as the git branching strategy, as GitFlow might be too complicated for this small project.

## Database

I chose **PostgreSQL** as my database management system because it is a robust and scalable open source DBMS. In addition to its efficiency in processing large amounts of data, it complies with a large number of SQL standards, which makes it possible to quickly migrate the database to another DBMS if needed.
